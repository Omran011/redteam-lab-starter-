# üîç Nmap Scanning Commands

This README explains a set of commonly used **Nmap** commands for network scanning. Each command includes a short description and usage notes. Use this file as a reference or learning note for GitHub.

## Project Description

A simple documentation file for Nmap commands used for host discovery, port scanning, OS detection, and aggressive scanning. Suitable to upload to GitHub as a quick reference.

---

## Commands Explained

### 1. Ping Scan (Host Discovery)

```bash
nmap -sn 10.0.2.0/24
```

**Description:** Performs a *ping scan* on the subnet `10.0.2.0/24` to list hosts that are **up** without scanning ports.

**When to use:** Use this for quick network discovery before doing detailed scans.

### 2. Top 20 Ports Scan

```bash
nmap --top-ports 20 10.0.2.4
```

**Description:** Scans the **top 20 most commonly used ports** on the target `10.0.2.4` to quickly identify important services.

---

### 3. OS Detection

```bash
nmap -O 10.0.2.4
```

**Description:** Attempts to detect the **operating system** of the target host by analyzing TCP/IP responses and fingerprints.

**Note:** Accuracy depends on network conditions and target configuration.

---

### 4. Aggressive Scan

```bash
nmap -A 10.0.2.4
```

**Description:** Performs an **aggressive scan** that includes:

* OS detection
* Version detection (`-sV`)
* Nmap script scanning
* Traceroute

This provides a comprehensive profile of the target and is useful in a lab environment for reconnaissance.

### 5. Specific Port Scan

```bash
nmap -p 80 10.0.2.4
```

**Description:** Scans only **port 80 (HTTP)** on the target to check if it is open and to identify the service/version running on that port.

## Quick Summary

| Command                        | Purpose              | Target      | Notes                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `nmap -sn 10.0.2.0/24`         | Host discovery       | Subnet      | Lists active hosts only   |
| `nmap --top-ports 20 10.0.2.4` | Quick port scan      | Single host | Scans top 20 ports        |
| `nmap -O 10.0.2.4`             | OS detection         | Single host | Uses TCP/IP fingerprints  |
| `nmap -A 10.0.2.4`             | Aggressive/full scan | Single host | Gathers advanced info     |
| `nmap -p 80 10.0.2.4`          | Port-specific scan   | Single host | Checks a specific service |

## Important Notes

* Always perform scans **with permission** from the network or system owner. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and unethical.
* Combine options like `-sV` (service/version detection) with `-p` to get more detailed results.
* Use these commands in a controlled lab or authorized assessment only.
