When hackers or security testers look at a website, what they see is usually just the front entrance 🚪.
But websites often have hidden files, secret directories, or parameters that are not publicly shown.

👉 If attackers find these hidden spots, they can sometimes discover sensitive information or even vulnerabilities.

So how do we find these “hidden doors”?
That’s where ffuf (Fuzz Faster U Fool) comes in.

🔑 What is ffuf?
ffuf is a fast web fuzzing tool written in Go.
It is mainly used to discover hidden files, directories, and parameters on a website.
Security researchers and bug bounty hunters love it because it’s blazing fast ⚡ and easy to use.
📖 A Simple Story
Think of a giant hotel 🏨:

Only some doors are shown on the hotel map.
But you have a keyring with thousands of keys 🔑.
You try each one quickly to see which doors unlock.
👉 Suddenly, you find a secret room 🚪✨ that no one told you about.

That’s ffuf for websites:

Keys = Wordlist (list of possible paths like admin, backup.zip, config)
Doors = Website endpoints
Secret rooms = Hidden files or directories
⚡ Example of Using ffuf
Let’s say we want to test a site:

ffuf -u https://example.com/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/common.txt
Here’s what happens:

-u → The target URL (the word FUZZ is replaced by words from the list).
-w → The wordlist (possible paths to test).
👉 ffuf will try:

https://example.com/admin
https://example.com/login
https://example.com/backup.zip
and thousands more…
If a response is valid, ffuf shows it as a found path ✅.

🛡️ Why ffuf is Important
🔍 Finds hidden files/directories developers forgot to hide.
⚡ Super fast (much quicker than older tools).
🧑‍💻 Bug bounty hunters’ favorite for quick reconnaissance.
🎯 Helps discover entry points for further testing.
🌍 Real-World Use Cases
Discovering /admin pages not linked publicly.
Finding forgotten backup files (backup.zip, db.sql).
Identifying API endpoints (/api/v1/users).
Fuzzing GET/POST parameters to check for hidden features.
🧠 Final Thoughts
ffuf is like having a master keyring 🔑 for the web.
It doesn’t break in by force — it just checks every possible door until it finds one that opens.

For security professionals and bug bounty hunters, it’s one of the most powerful ways to discover the “hidden parts” of the web that others miss.

👉 In short:

ffuf = 🔎 Discover hidden stuff fast.
Easy, powerful, and a must-have tool for web security testing.
