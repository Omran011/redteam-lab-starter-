Red Team Learning Roadmap 


This repository is part of my personal **Red Team learning roadmap** â€” a structured plan to build deep, practical skills in offensive security.
My journey focuses on developing both **technical expertise** and **ethical responsibility** through hands-on labs and tool creation.


#### ðŸ“š Learning Phases
1. **Phase 1 â€“ Core Foundation**
- Linux mastery, networking, and scripting (Bash & Python).
- Understanding system internals and privilege models.
2. **Phase 2 â€“ Offensive Basics**
- Web exploitation fundamentals (XSS, SQLi, LFI, RCE).
- Manual testing + automation using Burp Suite and custom scripts.
3. **Phase 3 â€“ Tool Development**
- Writing Red Team tools (scanners, payload generators, automation).
- Secure coding, data parsing, and reporting modules.
4. **Phase 4 â€“ Full Operations**
- Simulating attacks in lab environments (C2 setup, persistence, evasion).
- Documenting everything as part of a professional Red Team portfolio.
5. **Phase 5 â€“ Continuous Growth**
- Studying advanced topics: malware development, privilege escalation, network pivoting.
- Contributing to open-source security tools.


#### ðŸ’¡ Goal
To combine **technical offensive knowledge** with **ethical awareness**, leading to professional-level capability in Red Team operations.
